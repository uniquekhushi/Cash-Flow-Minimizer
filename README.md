# Cash-Flow-Minimizer
The Cash Flow Minimizer project aims to reduce the number of financial transactions required to settle debts among multiple banks. The primary goal is to optimize cash flows and minimize transaction costs by consolidating payments and using an intermediary (World Bank) when direct transactions are not possible due to differing payment modes.

# Greedy Algorithm

 Greedy Algorithm for Minimizing Transactions:

A greedy algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step to find a globally optimal solution. It operates on the principle of “taking the best option now” without considering the long-term consequences.
